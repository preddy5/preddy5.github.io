Finding the decomposition of an image into individual objects is a key step to leverage compositionality and to perform symbolic reasoning. Traditionally, this problem is solved as supervised segmentation task, which does not generalize beyond the scope of the supervision. More recently, unsupervised methods have been proposed that train a network to decompose a scene into a sparse set of objects, but their entangled latent representation hides information about the objects. We propose modelling the decomposition using sets of parameterized objects that enables unsupervised decomposition with a direct optimization over parameter space instead of employing a network. We show that this both improves the decomposition performance significantly, and gives us additional information about the objects, in the form of visual concepts, that is not available to the network-based methods.
